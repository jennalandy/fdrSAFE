Description: fdrSAFE estimates local and tail-end false discovery rates from a selective ensemble of models from the fdrtool, locfdr, and qvalue packages. 
  This method is introduced in the manuscript "fdrSAFE: Selective Aggregation for Local False Discovery Rate Estimation". 
  This framework selects models to ensemble by their approximate performances, which are estimated using simulated labeled data informed by domain knowledge of the latent label structure.
