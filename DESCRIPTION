Description: 
  Gridsemblefdr computes local and tail-end false discovery rates using ensemble methods. 
  This method is introduced in the in-progress paper "Ensembling for Unsupervised Learning with Application to False Discovery Rates". 
  This framework selects models to ensemble by their approximate performances, which are estimated using simulated labeled data informed by domain knowledge of the latent label structure.
